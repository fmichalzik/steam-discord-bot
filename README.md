# steam-discord-bot
First personal python project. <br>

The idea is to utilize API calls to recieve data from Steam and use the data for a discord bot to post stuff on a personal discord. 

### Initial Steps
- learning / understanding steams api
- create the first api call function (like get topseller)
- create a initial framework so additional call functions can be added later

- learn about discord bots
- setup a discord bot for a personal discord
- find a way "for the discord bot to youse the api call functions"
