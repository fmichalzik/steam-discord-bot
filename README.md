# steam-discord-bot
First personal python project. <br>

The idea is to utilize API calls to recieve data from Steam and use the data for a discord bot to post stuff on a personal discord. 

### Initial Steps
- learning / understanding steams api (/)
- create the first api call function (like get topseller) (/)
- create a initial framework so additional call functions can be added later

- learn about discord bots
- setup a discord bot for a personal discord
- find a way "for the discord bot to youse the api call functions"


### Setup
Set up a virtual environment. Virtual environments are Python's way<br>
to keep dependencies separate from other projects on our machine.
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the requirements.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

discount - defaults to 33
