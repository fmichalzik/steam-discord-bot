# steam-discord-bot
First personal python project. <br>

This discord bot is designed to request data from Steam and use that data. For example to post the recent steam topsellers or search for a game on steam.
You will encounter a lot of german for the bot messages and they are pirate-ish in style, cause i built this bot for a pirate themed discord channel.
The bots name is 'BootyBot' and he searches for treasures (aka discounted topsellers on steam) ...  ... but feel free to change to messages to your liking.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- A Discord bot token
- Discord server with admin rights
- A way to host the discord bot

### Setup
Clone repo and set up a virtual environment. Virtual environments are Python's way<br>
to keep dependencies separate from other projects on our machine.

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You have to create a .env file at the root of the project. This is where you store your public key for your discord.dev application
```
DISCORD_TOKEN = yourKey
```

### Starting the Bot
With venv running, and from the root of the project:
```
python src/discordbot.py
```

### Hosting
If you started the bot from you working machine, the bot will shut down as soon as you kill you terminal session.<br>
In order to host the bot, there a online service that can do that. I use a raspberry pi and systemd to host the bot.<br>
Set up your bot as a Linux service, so it starts on boot and restarts automatically.<br>
Example service file:
```
# /etc/systemd/system/discordbot.service

[Unit]
Description=Discord Bot
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/your-bot-folder
ExecStart=/home/pi/your-bot-folder/venv/bin/python bot.py
Restart=always
User=pi

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Make sure the service file is owned and readable by root:
```
sudo chown root:root /etc/systemd/system/discordbot.service
sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/discordbot.service
```
Then:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl enable discordbot
sudo systemctl start discordbot
```
To check status:
```
sudo systemctl status discordbot
```
To follow logs:
```
journalctl -u discordbot -f
```
To restart the bot service:
```
sudo systemctl restart discordbot
# or
sudo systemctl stop discordbot
sudo systemctl start discordbot
```
