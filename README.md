# steam-discord-bot
First personal python project. <br>

The idea is to utilize API calls to recieve data from Steam and use the data for a discord bot to post stuff on a personal discord. 

### Initial Steps
- learning / understanding steams api (/)
- create the first api call function (like get topseller) (/)
- create a initial framework so additional call functions can be added later

- learn about discord bots
- setup a discord bot for a personal discord
- find a way "for the discord bot to youse the api call functions"


### Setup
Set up a virtual environment. Virtual environments are Python's way<br>
to keep dependencies separate from other projects on our machine.
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the requirements.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You have to create a .env file at the root of the project. This is where you store your public key for your discord.dev application
```
DISCORD_TOKEN = yourKey
```

### Starting the Bot
With venv running, and from the root of the project:
```
python src/discordbot.py
```

### Hosting
If you started the bot from you working machine, the bot will shut down as soon as you kill you terminal session.<br>
In order to host the bot, there a online service that can do that. I use a raspberry pi and systemd to host the bot.<br>
Set up your bot as a Linux service, so it starts on boot and restarts automatically.<br>
Example service file:
```
# /etc/systemd/system/discordbot.service

[Unit]
Description=Discord Bot
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/your-bot-folder
ExecStart=/home/pi/your-bot-folder/venv/bin/python bot.py
Restart=always
User=pi

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Make sure the service file is owned and readable by root:
```
sudo chown root:root /etc/systemd/system/discordbot.service
sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/discordbot.service
```
Then:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl enable discordbot
sudo systemctl start discordbot
```
To check status:
```
sudo systemctl status discordbot
```
To follow logs:
```
journalctl -u discordbot -f
```
To restart the bot service:
```
sudo systemctl restart discordbot
# or
sudo systemctl stop discordbot
sudo systemctl start discordbot
```
